## Description:

In this project, I implemented the method of real time rendering technique from the paper [Axis-aligned filtering for interactive soft shadows](http://graphics.berkeley.edu/papers/UdayMehta-AAF-2012-12/UdayMehta-AAF-2012-12.pdf) from scratch. The whole implementation is based on Nvidia Optix with the GPU of GTX 980. And I made some analysis based on materials provided by paper as well as actual results I have achieved by myself. Also rendered another two scene, which is tree scene and dragon scene.
